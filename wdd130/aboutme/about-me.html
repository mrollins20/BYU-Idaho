        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Marc Rollins and I live in Sahuarita Arizona. I am 22 years old and have been a
            member
            of the church my entire life.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in computer and web programming after having completed the
            BYU Pathway program last semester. I enjoy playing video games, going camping, and woodworking. Something
            interesting about me is that I have a pet sun conure who is about to turn 1 year old in a month.</p>
        <p> I look forward to working with you all this semester!</p>
