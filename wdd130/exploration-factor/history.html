            <p>What we love about Metroidvanias can be said in only one way. We seek an adventure in a world so
                interconnected that simply changing one thing in a subsequent playthrough can change the entire game
                experience.</p>

            <p>What is a Metroidvania? A Metroidvania is a coined term combining the names of Metroid and Castlevania.
                This sub-genre of Action-adventure game is designed with a focus on non-linearity and utility-gated
                exploration. The term was popularized by Jeremy Parish, who tries to catalogue all Metroidvanias on his
                website, retronauts.com. While Metroidvanias are almost considered a niche sub-genre, their ideas and
                designs are very prevalent in most games.</p>
            <p>Metroidvanias are heavily based around a player's ability to memorize the world and abilities that they
                have; And to use them in clever ways to explore and unearth areas/items that were previously
                unreachable. For many people a single playthrough is all that is needed, but Metroidvanias gain a lot of
                their popularity from 'sequence breaks'. A sequence break is when a player uses in-game knowledge and
                skill to perform tricks that yield items and gear out of order from the intended gameplay. This kind of
                gameplay makes designing a Metroidvania very difficult and sometimes frustrating. One popular
                Metroidvania is called Ori and the blind forest. Thomas Mahler of Moon Studios, who developed the game,
                stated, “players remembering the levels is part of the core design.” This means that the world that
                developers of Metroidvanias must design unique areas across the entire game to make it easier for
                players to remember. Similarly, Daniel Smith of Moon Studios who was the executive producer over Ori's
                sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, stated, “I don't think people generally consider how difficult it
                is to make a Metroidvania game. Everything is so interconnected that if you change one aspect of the
                game, it's just inevitable that it's going to influence the rest.”</p>
